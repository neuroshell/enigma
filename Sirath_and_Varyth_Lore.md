# The Sirath and Varyth, the Mesmerant

## Overview
The Sirath are a new race of shapeshifting, psionic entities born from a dark matter singularity predating the Traveler. Led by Varyth, the Mesmerant, a female-presenting overlord, they wield lust, envy, and jealousy to sow chaos among Sol’s inhabitants. Emerging in *The Edge of Fate* expansion (July 2025), the Sirath and Varyth threaten the Vanguard by manipulating key relationships—Saint-14 and Osiris, Eris Morn and the Drifter, and Crow and Mara Sov—feeding on emotional discord to power their chaotic agenda. Their connection to the Nine and the Fate Saga’s dark matter mysteries makes them a formidable new threat in *Destiny 2*.

## The Sirath: A New Race
### Origins
The Sirath coalesced from a collapsing dark matter nebula, a failed experiment by the Nine to create sentient life before humanity’s Golden Age. Resenting the Traveler’s Light and the Witness’s Darkness for imposing order on the universe’s chaos, they view themselves as its true heirs. Their society worships the Nexus, a sentient singularity they believe holds the power to reshape reality. The Sirath’s emergence on Kepler, the new destination in *The Edge of Fate*, aligns with the Nine’s cryptic machinations, positioning them as a wildcard faction.

### Appearance
Sirath have fluid, humanoid forms with prismatic, bioluminescent skin that shifts to reflect their target’s idealized desires—appearing as a flawless Eliksni to a Fallen or a radiant Guardian to a human. Their true form is a swirling vortex of dark energy, revealed only in combat or distress. Their aesthetic is sleek and alien, with glowing patterns that pulse hypnotically, evoking allure without relying on exaggerated physicality.

### Culture and Behavior
The Sirath operate as a loose hive-mind, with each individual capable of projecting a unique persona to infiltrate and destabilize. They thrive on emotional manipulation, using psionic powers to amplify lust (unfulfilled desires), envy (resentment of others’ strengths), and jealousy (fear of losing bonds). Their goal is to unravel alliances, turning allies against each other through deception. Unlike the Hive’s overt conquest or the Vex’s cold logic, the Sirath’s chaos is subtle, psychological, and deeply personal.

### Gameplay Role
- **Enemy Types**:
  - **Mesmers**: Agile grunts that emit psychic pulses, disorienting players with HUD distortions or inverted controls.
  - **Mirrors**: Mid-tier shapeshifters that mimic player abilities (e.g., copying a Titan’s barricade), requiring adaptive strategies.
  - **Eidolons**: Heavy units that project illusions of other enemy races (e.g., a faux Cabal Colossus), adding variety to encounters.
- **Unique Mechanic**: A “Deception Gauge” in encounters forces players to identify the “true” Sirath among illusions to deal optimal damage, blending puzzle-solving with combat. This challenges speedrunners to optimize timing and coordination.
- **Integration**: The Sirath appear on Kepler as a secondary faction alongside the Nine’s forces, manipulating events to destabilize Sol. Their encounters range from campaign missions to a raid or dungeon, with dynamic mechanics that reward teamwork.

## Varyth, the Mesmerant
### Backstory
Varyth, the first Sirath, was created by the Nine to observe the Traveler’s arrival in Sol. Betraying their neutrality, she forged the Sirath into a force to challenge both Light and Darkness. She sees the Fate Saga’s prophecy as a chance to seize the Nexus and impose “perfect chaos,” freeing the universe from structured destinies. Her powers draw from emotional turmoil, growing stronger as she sows discord among Sol’s heroes.

### Appearance
Varyth’s default form is a sleek, female-presenting humanoid with prismatic, bioluminescent skin and flowing robes of dark energy. Her glowing eyes pulse with hypnotic patterns, and her sultry, menacing voice weaves taunts that feel personal. She shapeshifts into idealized forms—perhaps a radiant Awoken queen to Crow or a stoic Titan to Saint-14—tailored to exploit her targets’ desires. Her design balances sensuality with *Destiny 2*’s mythic aesthetic, avoiding caricature while evoking a seductive, alien charisma.

### Personality and Motivation
Charismatic, cunning, and theatrical, Varyth delights in unraveling trust through riddles and illusions. Her powers feed on lust (amplifying unfulfilled desires), envy (stoking resentment), and jealousy (exploiting fears of betrayal). She targets the Vanguard’s emotional bonds to destabilize their unity, viewing free will as a flaw to exploit. Her ultimate goal is to harness the Nexus to rewrite reality, making her a direct threat to Ikora Rey’s leadership in *The Edge of Fate*.

### Impact on Relationships
Varyth’s manipulations target three key relationships, creating narrative stakes:
- **Saint-14 and Osiris**: Varyth appears to Saint-14 as a vision of a younger, idealized Osiris, whispering doubts about Osiris’s loyalty post-*Lightfall*. She exploits Saint’s protective nature, suggesting Osiris hides secrets about the Nine, straining their bond. Campaign dialogue reveals Saint’s rare vulnerability, with players tasked to restore his trust.
- **Eris Morn and the Drifter**: Varyth preys on Eris’s insecurities about the Drifter’s wandering nature, projecting illusions of him charming others. This fuels Eris’s jealousy, culminating in a mission where players shield Eris from a psychic assault, exploring her struggle to trust her partner.
- **Crow and Mara Sov**: Varyth exploits Crow’s complicated loyalty to Mara, appearing as an idealized Mara who promises unconditional acceptance. She stokes Crow’s envy of Mara’s power and his fear of being a pawn, pushing him to question his role in the Vanguard. A campaign mission involves players helping Crow resist her influence, deepening his arc.

### Gameplay Role
- **Campaign Role**: Varyth appears throughout *The Edge of Fate*’s campaign, manipulating allies like Lodi and enemies like the Nine’s forces. Her missions involve psychic puzzles, such as discerning her “true” form among illusions of Zavala or Ikora, with dialogue laced with seductive taunts.
- **Raid/Dungeon Boss**: Varyth’s final encounter in a dark matter rift features a multi-phase fight:
  - **Phase 1: Lust’s Pull** – Varyth summons illusions of fireteam members, forcing players to avoid friendly fire. A “Desire Gauge” fills if players hesitate, boosting her damage.
  - **Phase 2: Envy’s Sting** – She projects clones of iconic enemies (e.g., a faux Taniks), exploiting players’ resentment of past foes. Players break her psychic barriers through coordinated mechanics.
  - **Phase 3: Jealousy’s Chaos** – Varyth curses one player with a “Jealousy Curse,” causing their abilities to harm teammates unless cleansed via teamwork. Speedrunners will optimize this phase with precise communication.
  - **Signature Ability**: “Mirage of Desire” creates chaotic effects like inverted controls or false objectives, reflecting her emotional manipulation.
- **Loot and Rewards**:
  - **Exotic Weapon**: “Lure of Chaos” (Trace Rifle) – Fires a beam that confuses enemies, causing them to attack each other. Perk: “Heart’s Ruin” – Precision hits increase enemy aggression.
  - **Armor Set**: Sirath-themed armor with sleek, prismatic designs, offering perks that resist debuffs or boost ability regeneration when countering illusions.
  - **Shader**: “Prismatic Allure” – A shifting, bioluminescent shader inspired by Varyth’s skin.

## Narrative Integration
The Sirath and Varyth tie into *The Edge of Fate*’s focus on the Nine and dark matter. Varyth manipulates Lodi, the new ally, to undermine Ikora’s leadership, creating a power struggle that players resolve across the campaign. Her influence on Saint-14/Osiris, Eris/Drifter, and Crow/Mara adds emotional depth, with lore entries exploring how these characters rebuild trust post-campaign. Varyth’s defeat weakens the Sirath but leaves the Nexus active, setting up their return in *Renegades* as a lingering threat, potentially tying into its Star Wars-inspired elements.

## Why This Works
- **Lore Fit**: The Sirath and Varyth expand the Fate Saga’s themes, introducing a fresh faction that complements the Nine’s mystery without overshadowing existing races. Their psychological manipulation echoes Savathûn’s deception but feels distinct.
- **Gameplay Innovation**: The Sirath’s shapeshifting and Varyth’s illusion-based mechanics offer new challenges, appealing to speedrunners (optimizing Deception Gauge mechanics) and casual players (immersed in story-driven encounters).
- **Community Appeal**: Varyth’s seductive, alien charisma avoids divisive tropes, balancing allure with *Destiny 2*’s mythic tone. Her impact on fan-favorite relationships ensures emotional resonance.
- **Longevity**: The Sirath’s Nexus and Varyth’s lingering influence set up future conflicts, ensuring narrative depth beyond one expansion.
